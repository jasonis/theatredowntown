            <p>A hilarious comedy about two English Shakespearean actors, Jack (Robb Ross) and Leo
			(Michael Colavolpe), who find themselves so down on their luck that they are performing
			"Scenes from Shakespeare" on the Moose Lodge circuit in the Amish country of Pennsylvania.
			When they hear that an old lady in York, PA is about to die and leave her fortune to her two
			long lost English nephews, they resolve to pass themselves off as her beloved relatives and
			get the cash. The trouble is, when they get to York, they find out that the relatives aren't
			nephews, but nieces! Romantic entanglements abound, especially when Leo falls head-overpetticoat
			in love with the old lady’s vivacious niece, Meg (Jamie-Lyn Hawkins), who’s engaged
			to the local minister. Meg knows that there’s a wide world out there, but it’s not until she
			meets “Maxine and Stephanie” that she finally gets a taste of it.</p>
