			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>With its pedigreed origins in downtown Orlando’s Tropical Theatre, 
			Theatre Downtown continues an ongoing tradition of theatrical excellence well 
			into its 18th year.</p>
			
			<p>Our location at 2113 N Orange Avenue opened to the public in early 1989 
			with its first production of David Mamet’s <em>American Buffalo</em> we have not 
			looked back since.</p>
			
			<p>Since that first production, Theatre Downtown has proven to be an invaluable 
			cultural resource for the Central Florida Community, producing hundreds of plays 
			from classics to cutting edge productions. Whether producing <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>, 
			or <em>The Tempest</em>, contemporary plays such as Sylvia or <em>Wonder of the World</em>
			...or original works from local playwrights, we bring our unique blend of professionalism, 
			experience, and dedication to our work.</p>
			
			<p>Theatre Downtown was voted <em>&quot;Best Local Repertory Company&quot;</em> 
			in the Orlando Weekly’s Best of Orlando Promotion in 2001.</p>
			
			<p>Theatre Downtown is dedicated to create a broader base of aesthetic possibilities 
			in the Central Florida area by producing and spotlighting unique plays and artists.</p>
			
			<p>We shall accomplish this by: producing stimulating, entertaining, and 
			thought-provoking productions/events for Central Florida audiences, providing a 
			supportive environment in which local artists can experiment, develop and share 
			their talents, and by maximizing the potential of the physical plant in order to 
			provide creative possibilities for as many individuals as possible.</p>
